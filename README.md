# Covid19-Analyzer-Project

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to analyze COVID-19 data from two reliable data sources to understand the spread, impact, and trends of the pandemic across various regions. This includes identifying key patterns, such as new_cases_per_million, new_death_cases_per_million, Obesity rates, median age, impact from Diabetes, testing rates etc.

I worked on this project by refering to Derek Banas's github repository. Reference: https://github.com/derekbanas/Covid-19-Data-Analysis 

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Web Scrapping
- Excel


## Pyhon & Web Scrapping Skills Acquired

- Use of Numpy & Pandas (data manipulation libraries)
- Use of Matplotlib and Plotly (visualization libraries)
- Use of Web Scrapping libraries like BeautifulSoup
- And much more ðŸ˜…

## Key Concepts

- Moving Average
- Correlation does not imply causation


The project begins by asking the below questions to better understand the Global Pandemic Covid-19 and to harness the power of data analysis to answer the questions.

- How can we examine the progress of a country?
- Do lockdowns work?
- How Does Median Age Effect Death Rate?
- How Does Obesity Effect Death Rate?
- How Does Diabetes Prevalence Effect Death?
- Does More Testing Slow Deathrate?
